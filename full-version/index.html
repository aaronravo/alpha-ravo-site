        <p class="founder-titles">USC athlete → Serial entrepreneur → AI executive → Biohacker</p>
        <p class="founder-bio">Former USC athlete. Built in competition, forged in discipline. He didn't enter business as an employee—he entered as a builder. Founded and scaled multiple companies; most recently President of an AI company, three years deep in infrastructure and applied integration. Years of controlled experimentation in recovery, hormones, nutrition, strength, and cognitive performance. He treats physiology and mindset like an operating system—and runs nightly directive resets to design trajectory instead of drifting through it.</p>
