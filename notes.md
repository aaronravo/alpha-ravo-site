# Alpha Ravo Website – Notes

This folder will contain the actual website code when we are ready (e.g. a landing page, marketing site, or full app).

## Brand Assets

- **Logo:** `assets/alpha-ravo-logo.png` — "ALPHA RAVO" wordmark, cream on black, target-style "O" in RAVO. Use in header and hero on dark backgrounds.

See `docs/brand-assets.md` for full brand notes (colors, typography, tone).

## Initial Plan

- Start with a **single-page marketing site** that:
  - Explains what Alpha Ravo is and who it is for.
  - Describes how the program works and why it is credible.
  - Captures emails / applications for early access and investors.

- Later, evolve into:
  - A full marketing site with more pages.
  - Potentially a logged-in app experience if Alpha Ravo becomes app-first.

## Launch version (current)

- **`index.html`** – Minimal one-page: hero (logo + “Recode your mind. Realign your life.” + subline + Get updates) + contact section (email only, “Join”).
- **`styles.css`** – Dark theme, hero + contact only; lightweight for launch.
- **`main.js`** – Form submit handler (works for `#contact-form`).
- **`assets/`** – Logo.

**To view:** Open `website/index.html` in a browser.

## Full version (saved for later)

- **`full-version/`** – Complete site with problem, solution, how it works, science, founder, full apply form. Open `full-version/index.html` to view (assets load from `../assets/`). Use when you want to publish the full story without giving away everything at once.
